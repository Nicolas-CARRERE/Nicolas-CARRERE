💻Passionate about programming from an early age, I spent 15 years developing applications in Visual Basic during my previous functions in an industrial environment.
Over this period, I worked a lot on HMIs, data processing and the provision of key indicators for decision support.
👨‍🎓With this experience and wanting to live 100% of my passion, I turned to a solid training in Web development at the Wild Code School in order to embrace a new career.
 
🚀 Anxious to improve myself and practice in business, I want to continue my diploma training course. For this, I am already looking for a work-study contract from March 2023 to February 2024 🗓️
